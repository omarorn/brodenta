3. **Creates** `wrangler.toml` with your account settings
4. **Deploys** `worker.js` to Cloudflare Workers
5. **Sets up** custom domain: `madenta.2076.is`
6. **Verifies** deployment on both URLs
7. **Reports** deployment status

### **Error: "Custom domain already exists"**
Delete existing custom domain first:
1. Go to: Workers & Pages → madenta-game → Settings → Domains
2. Delete old `madenta.2076.is` entry
3. Re-run deployment script

---

## 🔄 TO UPDATE THE GAME
