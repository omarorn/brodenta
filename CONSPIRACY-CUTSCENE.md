### SCENE 1: The Secret Meeting

**Location:** Abandoned Dental Warehouse, Budapest Underground

**Camera pans through dark corridors, stops at a lit room**

---

**DR. ENDLESS FILLING:** *(on phone)*  
"Yes, we have 47 teeth ready for pickup. Fresh extractions from unnecessary procedures."

**DECAY DANCER:** *(materializes from purple mist)*  
"Excellent. My Ray Gun factory needs constant supply. These will make beautiful ammunition."

**DR. CROWN PUSHER:**  
"Our deal is still 50 teeth per week, correct? My quota depends on it!"

**ROOT REAPER:** *(appears with bacteria swarm)*  
"Yes. And remember - the more pain you cause, the more fear energy we harvest. It powers our weapons."

### SCENE 2: The Factory

**Camera shows conveyor belt:**

```
EXTRACTED TEETH → DARK MAGIC CONVERSION → RAY GUN AMMO

  Innocent          Evil Fairy Tech        Weapon Pellets
  Patients            Processing          (cause cavities)
```

**DR. X-RAY SPAMMER:**  
"But what about that Madenta clinic? They're doing All-on-4. Permanent solutions. Our supply chain is at risk!"

**DECAY DANCER:** *(laughs)*  
"Don't worry. We sent Carius and Bactus to sabotage them. Once Dr. Dávid is gone, you'll have monopoly again."

"What?! Show me the recording!"

**GUNNAR:** *(Icelandic coordinator)*  
"Ég vissi það! I KNEW those bastards were up to something!"

**DR. GYÖRGY PÉTER:** *(Chief Surgeon)*  
"This explains everything. The sudden spike in cavities across Budapest. The Ray Gun attacks. It's all connected."

---

### SCENE 6: The Declaration

**DR. DÁVID:** *(stands up, determined)*  
"Then we must stop them. Not just for our patients - for EVERYONE."

**ÓMAR:**  
"But how? They have an army of extracted teeth and dark fairy magic!"
